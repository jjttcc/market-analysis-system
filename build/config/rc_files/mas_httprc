# Sample http configuration file - set up for yahoo.com
# (Currently, only end-of-day data retrieval is available.  Intraday may be
# added later.)

# Format: "label_string<tab>setting"

# Does the month in a date specification start at zero rather than one -
# that is, does 0 indicate January and 11 indicate December?
# NOTE: This specification does not apply to the month settings specified
# in this file, which always start at 1; rather it specifies how the date
# settings are translated into the "HTTP GET" request for retrieving the
# specified range of data.  Note that the chart.yahoo.com site expects (as
# of Sep. 2002) months to start at zero and thus months_start_at_zero
# should be set to true if you are using yahoo's site.
# (Change "true" below to "false" or simply delete the "months_start_at_zero"
# specification below, since the default is false, to specify that months
# start at one.)
months_start_at_zero	true

# Specification for the start and end dates for the data to be retrieved
# "now" means, of course, the current date; if an actual date is used,
# it must be of the form: yyyymmdd.
eod_start_date	now - 4 years
eod_end_date	now

# The host component of the http URL used to retrieve market data
host	chart.yahoo.com

# The path component of the http URL used to retrieve market data
path	table.csv?s=<symbol>&a=<startmonth>&b=<startday>&c=<startyear>&d=<endmonth>&e=<endday>&f=<endyear>&g=d&q=q&y=0&z=<symbol>&x=.csv

# Path of the file that contains the list of symbols for the tradables to
# be downloaded.  (In this case it's expected to be in the current
# directory.)
symbol_file	symbols

# The field separator to use for output when converting the retrieved data
# Must be just one character; If not specified, comma will be used.
output_field_separator	,

# The command to post-process the retrieved data, usually for the purpose of
# converting it into an expected format.  In this case, the specification
# is for a conversion component called "yahoo", which, as of July 2002, is
# the only internal conversion component available; more may be added later.
post_process_command	yahoo
#post_process_command	[none]

# The time at which to attempt to retrieve the latest end-of-day data from
# the http data-source site.  It should be in the user's local time.
# This needs to be set carefully: Too early and a lot of time will be wasted
# trying to retrieve data that doesn't exist yet; too late and your data
# will not be as up-to-date as it could be.  Format: hh:mm (24-hour clock)
eod_turnover_time	19:00

# These specifications prevent unecessary retrieval of data on a weekend
# if the current time is later than eod_turnover_time.  If data does need
# to be retrieved, remove or comment out the appropriate specification;
# for example, if a tradable is traded on Saturday and end-of-day data for
# it is available, comment out the "ignore_day_of_week	saturday"
# specification.
ignore_day_of_week	saturday
ignore_day_of_week	sunday
